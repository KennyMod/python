Every day, I make sure to solve a codewars.

## Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code as I learn daily the different ways to solve a challenge, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.
## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is starting low then going up one step at a time. Sometimes, even if you can't solve the question, take a break, manage frustration, be consitent and you will always come out on top.
